# WDI_PROJECT_4
Final Project of WDI 18 course.

In short, this is a Tinder for musicians in order to find other artists and/or producers for collaboration that I built in a week. You have to have a Soundcloud account in order to participate as a security measure for alleviating spam. 

The website is: https://studiovibes.herokuapp.com/


As this is an ongoing project, it may have to be run locally on localhost:8000 after express is listening on port 8000 (run nodemon in the terminal to make this happen) and mongo is running (mongod/sudo mongod in the terminal).
